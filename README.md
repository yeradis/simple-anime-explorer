# Simple Anime Explorer

## Why?

I just love to watch anime, i can spend hours watching it,
but the problem appears when you try to discover a new fascinating anime while on bed.

I know there are a lot of sites with great systems, even a lot of apps, but this shit is mine xDDDDDDD

Also, all have the same problem:
None of those offers me a way to navigate the list while iÂ´m in the bed using a simple interface,
a simple interface for my TV or my 24/27 screen xD

I so simple that there is no search function, no favorite, no bookmarks, just a navigation in two directions.

Because the idea of this is to explore a list to discover something interesting to watch xD

But if you are here at GitHub, you are looking for another stuff xD

## Tech

Just a simple WebApp consuming a simple Python API using JQuery.
Structured with a simple JavaScript Design Pattern know as Module Pattern

Also there is a simple offline pagination behavior that use some Media Queries.
